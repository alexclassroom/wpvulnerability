== Description ==

This plugin and the free and unlimited [WordPress Vulnerability Database](https://vulnerability.wpsysadmin.com/), allows to analyze all published vulnerabilities directly from your WordPress.

In case there is any documented vulnerability, you can visit the Site Heath of your WordPress and find the vulnerability information. You may find that your plugin or theme has a vulnerability, and it is as simple as upgrading to an updated version, or it will inform you if the plugin/theme is no longer available for download or does not have a patch.
