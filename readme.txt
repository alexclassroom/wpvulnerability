Display vulnerabilities in WordPress core, plugins, and themes using information from the [WordPress Vulnerability Database API](https://vulnerability.wpsysadmin.com/).

== Description ==

This plugin, with the free and unlimited [WordPress Vulnerability Database API](https://vulnerability.wpsysadmin.com/), allows to analyze all published vulnerabilities directly from your WordPress.

* The current version of your WordPress will be checked.

* All the themes you have, whether from the repository, external or premium, will be checked.

In case there is any documented vulnerability, you can visit the Site Heath of your WordPress and find the vulnerability information. You may find that your plugin or theme has a vulnerability, and it is as simple as upgrading to an updated version; it will inform you if the plugin/theme is no longer available for download or does not have a patch.

In settings you will have the options to send notification periodically for your installation. You can select between every day or weekly basis.
